#Mounting and Unmounting a LUKS Encrypted USB Volume
### Mounting and Unmounting a LUKS Encrypted USB Volume
This process also works for hard drives.
#### Basic commands to view the disks/USB devices:

- blkid
- duf
- lsblk
- lsblk -a
- lsblk -o +UUID,PARTUUID
- lsblk -o +UUID,FSTYPE,PARTUUID
- ls -lF /dev/disk/by-id
- sudo lshw -short -C disk
- sudo udisksctl info -b /dev/??


#### 01. USB drive has not been inserted (plugged in) yet.

To see volumes type:
```
lsblk
```

**<img src="../img/mount01.png" alt="Running lsblk shows what is currently mounted." />**<br />

#### 02. GUI password prompt when encrypted drive is plugged in (I clicked cancel to demonstrate mounting from commandline).

![ I clicked cancel to demonstrate mounting from commandline.](img/mount02.png "I clicked cancel to demonstrate mounting from commandline.")

#### 03. USB drive inserted (plugged in) and showing as /dev/sdm1.

To see volumes type:
```
lsblk
```

![ USB drive inserted (plugged in) and showing as /dev/sdm1.](img/mount03.png "USB drive inserted (plugged in) and showing as /dev/sdm1. Your volume name may be different than /dev/sdm1.")

#### 04. Check the volume information type:

```
sudo udisksctl info -b /dev/sdm1
or
sudo cryptsetup isLuks -v /dev/sdm1
```
The volume /dev/sdm1 shows as "crypto_LUKS".

![ See the various commands above to view drive/volumes. Your volume name may be different than /dev/sdm1.](img/mount04.png "See the various commands above to view drive/volumes. Your volume name may be different than /dev/sdm1.")

#### 05. If you try to mount the locked LUKS encrypted volume it will fail. (Screenshot shows mount failed. This is because the volume is locked. Run cryptsetup first to unlock.).

![ See the various commands to view drive/volumes above.](img/mount05.png "See the various commands to view drive/volumes above.")

#### 06. Running cryptsetup to unlock the encrypted volume (Assigning alias of "2T_SSD" to reference the unlocked volume. The alias can be whatever you want.).

To open the encrypted filesystem type:

```
sudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdm1 2T_SSD
```

![ The alias name can be whatever you want.](img/mount06.png "The alias name can be whatever you want.")

#### 07. Decrypted volume showing as 2T_SSD, but not yet mounted.

To see the unlocked volume type:
```
lsblk
```

![ Decrypted volume showing the 2T_SSD alias, but not yet mounted.](img/mount07.png "Decrypted volume showing the 2T_SSD alias, but not yet mounted.")

#### 08. Decrypted volume alias "2T_SSD" showing under /dev/mapper.

Check /dev/mapper to see if your alias is there:

```
ls -al /dev/mapper
```

![ Decrypted volume alias "2T_SSD" showing under /dev/mapper.](img/mount08.png "Decrypted volume alias "2T_SSD" showing under /dev/mapper.")

#### 09. Password prompt when using sudo to mount decrypted 2T_SSD volume to /dev/m.

To mount your alias to a mount point type:
```
sudo mount /dev/mapper/2T_SSD /mnt/m
```

![ Password prompt when using sudo to mount decrypted 2T_SSD volume to the /dev/m mount point (The mount point can be whatever you want.](img/mount09.png "Password prompt when using sudo to mount decrypted 2T_SSD volume to the /dev/m mount point (The mount point can be whatever you want.")

#### 10. Decrypted volume showing unlocked and mounted at /mnt/m.

To see volumes type:
```
lsblk
```

![ Decrypted volume showing unlocked and mounted at /mnt/m.](img/mount10.png "Decrypted volume showing unlocked and mounted at /mnt/m.")

#### 11. Unmounting /mnt/m.

To unmount the volume type:
```
sudo umount /mnt/m
```

![ Unmounting /mnt/m.](img/mount11.png "Unmounting /mnt/m.")

#### 12. Closing cryptsetup session (Locking it).

To close the volume type:
```
sudo cryptsetup close 2T_SSD
```

![ Closing cryptsetup session (Locking it).](img/mount12.png "Closing cryptsetup session (Locking it).")

#### 13. USB drive unmounted and unplugged from system.

To see volumes type:
```
lsblk
```

![ USB drive unmounted and unplugged from system.](img/mount13.png "USB drive unmounted and unplugged from system.")

### Mount a USB volume and use umask to allow "other" full access.
####
```
	sudo mount /dev/sdi1 /mnt/i -o umask=000,utf8
```

### Automatically mount using fstab.
##### You can automatically mount by UUID if you want the mount points to consistently mount to the same device. Each partition on a drive will have its own UUID.
Use this to find the UUID:
```
	lsblk -o +UUID,PARTUUID
```

```
In fstab;
	UUID=FC3E-233D /mnt/i auto   user,umask=000,utf8  0   0
	UUID=B06E-CC89 /mnt/c auto   user,umask=000,utf8  0   0
	UUID=02608207608201A1 /mnt/h auto   user,umask=000,utf8  0   0

	After editing the fstab file, run 'systemctl daemon-reload' to update systemd
```

### Luks Header Backup and Restore
#### https://www.cyberciti.biz/security/how-to-backup-and-restore-luks-header-on-linux/

####Creating LUKS Header Backup:<br />
  Syntax: sudo cryptsetup luksHeaderBackup /dev/XXX --header-backup-file myfile.bin
  <br />
  Example:<br />
  ```
  	sudo cryptsetup luksHeaderBackup /dev/sda3 --header-backup-file my_luks_header.bin
  	sudo cryptsetup luksHeaderBackup /dev/sdb --header-backup-file my_luks_header.bin
  ```
  <br />
  Side note:<br />
  The permission on the bin files that are created are 400 and the owner is root.
  <br />

  Check the file type:<br />
  ```
  	sudo file my_luks_header.bin
  	my_luks_header.bin: LUKS encrypted file, ver 2 [, , sha256] UUID: 9e5f5c4b-a4bb-464a-80c6-118c22e35e8f
  ```

  Use luksDump to view information about the file:<br />
  ```
  	sudo cryptsetup luksDump my_luks_header.bin
  ```

####Restoring LUKS header when needed:<br />
  ```
  	cryptsetup luksHeaderRestore /dev/XXX --header-backup-file /path/to/my_luks_header.bin
  	Assuming that your header file is on /dev/external/volume
  	cryptsetup luksHeaderRestore /dev/md1 --header-backup-file /dev/external/volume/my_luks_header.bin
  ```

  WARNING!<br />
  ========<br />
  Device /dev/XXX already contains LUKS2 header. Replacing header will destroy existing keyslots.
<br />
  Are you sure? (Type uppercase yes): YES
<br />
